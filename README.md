React + Node + PostgreSQL

# Frontend
To start the react app, make sure you are in the correct directory. Run ```npm install``` to install all dependencies, then run ```npm run start``` to run on localhost ```3000```.

# Backend
To start the node app, make sure you are in the correct directory. Run ```npm install``` to install all dependencies, then run ```npm run dev``` to run on localhost ```5000```.

We followed the MVC framework. All SQL queries are contained in the directory ```/models```. Each relation has its own model. SQL queries were written using ```node-pg```.

# Database
To start a PostgreSQL database, make sure you are using port ```5432```, user ```postgres```, and password ```postgres```. Then, create a database called ```saveinn```. Run the provided ```db.sql``` file to create all the tables in the database.
